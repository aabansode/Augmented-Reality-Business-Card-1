# Augmented-Reality-Business-Card
This is a Unity project that uses Vuforia to display an Augmented Reality card when the image saved as target in the Vuforia database is detected by the application. It is interactable and upon sliding up different featues of the business card can be seen. It also plays video on the back side of the card with audio and shows 3D objects in AR.
